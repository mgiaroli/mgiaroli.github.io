Since 2008, I have been a member of the Olympic Committee of Mateclubes, a team competition organized by the Argentinian Mathematics Olympiad 
for students between 9 and 16 years old. The committee elaborates the test of all instances and acts as a jury. I also participated in the writing of two 
[Mateclubes books](https://www.oma.org.ar/mateclubes/index.php/info/bibliografia), that include a compilation of mathematical problems and the corresponding solutions.
