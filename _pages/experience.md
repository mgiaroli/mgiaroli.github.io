## Research 

### [IMAS - CONICET](http://www.imas-uba-conicet.gob.ar/)

**Doctoral fellow**  
*2014-2019*

During my research, I applied and developed algebraic and geometric tools for the study of multistationarity in biochemical networks and, more generally,
positive solutions of sparse polynomial systems.  

I published, in collaboration with other researchers, 4 scientific articles in high impact peer-reviewed journals, and presented my research in national and international conferences.
