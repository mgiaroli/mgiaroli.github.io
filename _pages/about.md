Hi! I'm Magalí. I'm a mathematician, currently interested in beginning my path in data science and machine learning. 

I'm from Argentina. I've enjoyed math and solving problems ever since I participated in [Math Olympiads](https://oma.org.ar) during my school years. 
In 2019 I earned a Ph.D. in Mathematics from the [University of Buenos Aires](https://web.dm.uba.ar/). In addition to my research experience as a 
doctoral student, I have several years of university teaching.

After my graduation, I lived in Finland for two years. During this time, I started to learn the tools to switch from academy to industry. My skills include programming in Python, as well as using data science tools such as Pandas, NumPy, SciKit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn. I also have knowledge of Octave and SQL. You can see my projects in the Project Section. I am a curious person and I love learning new things.

Now, I'm back in Argentina, looking to apply my analytical skills as a mathematician to solve real-world data problems.
